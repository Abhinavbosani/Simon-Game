# Simon-Game

## Introduction
Welcome to Simon Game, a fun web game to play! Simon Game is a classic memory game where players have to remember and repeat sequences of colors.

## Gameplay:

1. The game begins with a short sequence played by the website, usually consisting of two or more colors.
2. After the sequence is played, the player must repeat it by pressing the corresponding buttons in the same order.
3. If the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds another randomly chosen color to the end of the sequence and repeats the entire sequence again.
4. The player must then repeat the longer sequence, including the new color.
5. This process continues, with the sequences becoming longer and more difficult, until the player makes a mistake.

Have fun playing Simon Game!
