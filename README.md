# Simon-Game
Hello this is fun web game to play
here are the rules

Gameplay:

1)The game begins with a short sequence played by the website, usually consisting of two or more colors.
2)After the sequence is played, the player must repeat it by pressing the corresponding buttons in the same order.
3)If the player successfully repeats the sequence, the game adds another randomly chosen color to the end of the sequence and repeats the entire sequence again.
4)The player must then repeat the longer sequence, including the new color.
5)This process continues, with the sequences becoming longer and more difficult, until the player makes a mistake.
